# Glowsquids Begone!

With 1.18.2 mojang finally realised glowsquids spawning in *all* water below y30 is dumb.
Annoyingly, that same update also made a bunch of under the hood changes that break basically every mod.
That's why I slapped together a mod in 5 minutes to backport the fixed glowsquid spawning to 1.18.1.
It's a single mixin, so I doubt there will be any bugs, but feel free to prove me wrong.
